    <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

        kept as long as necessary and can be deleted upon request.</p>

    <p>We do not store any personal data. If collection occurs in the future, appropriate security measures will be
        implemented.</p>

    <h2>7. Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
